Abstract:

For my project I would like to create a website that is a usefull tool for comic readers. I plan on scraping a large comic database for informaiton, either Comixology or wikipedia. The website will allow users to create their own lists of comics that they have read/plan to read/stopped reading/are currently reading. Each comic would have it's own information page, and on that page there would be commenting sections for written reviews as well as a voting system of comics/comic arcs that are reccomended to read as a build up to the page's comic. (IE: In order to understand Reign of the Supermen you should probably be reading funeral for a friend and the death of superman)
In addition to this, depending how succesful that part is, I would like to add a reccomendation system that would take ratings that you have given comics, and compare that with ratings others have given to them and then see what other similar comics would best fit your reccomendations based on their similar ratings etc.. 
A seprate idea I had for a feature is the ability for users to create reading orders for big cross over events. A current example of Marvel comics requires a lot of pre-reading to be able to jump in anywhere, so finding a clear and concise reading list for that would be extremely useful to someone trying to jump into reading. These would possibly be user voted for. So if someone releases a very good and comprehensive list for Flashpoint Paradox, it will float to the top and likely duplicates would only surpass it if the community thinks it should.
