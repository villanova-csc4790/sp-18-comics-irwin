#region //Core NEED TO DO Mechanics
/*---------------------------------------------------------------

//The only worthless guest, is one that can't leave a review.

TODO TOMORROW 11/18/18
Longer Term Ideas
0.1 - Implement the timers for bellhop calls
0.2 - Implement the objects for maids/bellhops they dont need stats or anything right now, just make them base objects.
1. Events! Yes No boxes of flavoured events that have a chance to trigger throughout the  day as certain CHECK lines occur. 
This will be the way that it works exactly as it needs to. 
2. maid and bellhop events give you an info box, requirements and then you drag the maid or bellhop into the face square for it. 
3. Make a vampire object

	C) Checks out at night/Checks in at night
2. Werewolves -
	A) Can not be put on the same floor as Vampires
	B) Require increased food/water
	C) Should not be put next to other guests
	D) Think about a check in time/mechanic
3. Mummy -
	A) Locks the room for the rest of the month
	B) Will not pull resources
	C) Maybe will fill multiple rooms
4. Swamp Man -
	A) First floor reccomended
	B) No electricity/Food. Increased water consumption
	C) Other mechanics?
5. Mostly Ghosty - dead guest names
	A) Needs empty rooms on either side or will spook guests
	B) No resources
	C) Ghost will give more money if rooms are filled, but humans will drop their rating(for each day maybe?)
6. Frankenstein's Cloned Monster

#region //Random Ideas
/*---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Human Guests have types, like couple, or family. 
2. daily challemges
3. endless -> skill tree
4. Prices for the rooms are randomized (Maybe tips are based on X percent of bill where X is based on the overall rating)
5. Big item purchases or rennovations that increase both room count/floorcount and something else about the hotel like food or something. This could present the late game.
