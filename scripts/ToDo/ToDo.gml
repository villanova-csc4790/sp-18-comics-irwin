//The only worthless guest, is one that can't leave a review.

TODO TOMORROW 11/7/18
-Ratings System/
-Maid system (Which I suppose is technically just the smae thing as the hunger system, but slightly different?)

Longer Term Ideas
1. Food and Cleanliness Requirements -
	B: Punishment for not making it to the call in enough time. This is where the rating score is important. Maybe even have it so staying heavily
	   them rewards a better 5.0 score? 
	BONUS: Perhaps it could be a random event that they will call about that requires the bellhop staff member, when you click the room you get a block
	of text that describes the event. Think about this way later, when you have more of a UI fleshed out.
2. Make a vampire object

	C) Checks out at night/Checks in at night
2. Werewolves -
	A) Can not be put on the same floor as Vampires
	B) Require increased food/water
	C) Should not be put next to other guests
	D) Think about a check in time/mechanic
3. Mummy -
	A) Locks the room for the rest of the month
	B) Will not pull resources
	C) Maybe will fill multiple rooms
4. Swamp Man -
	A) First floor reccomended
	B) No electricity/Food. Increased water consumption
	C) Other mechanics?
5. Mostly Ghosty - dead guest names
	A) Needs empty rooms on either side or will spook guests
	B) No resources
	C) Ghost will give more money if rooms are filled, but humans will drop their rating(for each day maybe?)
6. Frankenstein's Cloned Monster
	A) First floor for noise complaints
	B) Electricity ++ Food -- Water --
	C) Checks in during storms
	D) Can not be on the same floor as the fire elemental(?)

#region //Random Ideas
/*---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Human Guests have types, like couple, or family. 
2. daily challemges
3. endless -> skill tree
4. Prices for the rooms are randomized (Maybe tips are based on X percent of bill where X is based on the overall rating)
