//The only worthless guest, is one that can't leave a review.

TODO TOMORROW 11/5/18
-Read and implement information in the oGuest to create an information object that displays and has a book button.
-Make the game start running real time
-Ratings System/Maid system should be done tomorrow as well.
-Prices for the rooms are randomized (Maybe tips are based on X percent of bill where X is based on the overall rating)

00.Possibly running switch in switch and the random spawn time will be something like (random(400,500) where that is the time in the alarm to spawn in maybe? 

1. Food and Cleanliness Requirements -
	B: Punishment for not making it to the call in enough time. This is where the rating score is important. Maybe even have it so staying heavily
	   them rewards a better 5.0 score? 
	BONUS: Perhaps it could be a random event that they will call about that requires the bellhop staff member, when you click the room you get a block
	of text that describes the event. Think about this way later, when you have more of a UI fleshed out.
2. Look at the idea of the list of maps that you can pop off or whatever.
3. Make a vampire script
4. Start to work on the timelining - Maybe actually look at timelines. If not, lets maybe look at fleshing out the clock system for the month to month stuff
	Thoughts on this are, the clock object will maintain the day to day tracking, but perhaps it has month variables and week within that month variables, and 
	that will call the actual scripts to run on those days? Think more about this.
